At the first run, you will be prompted for the DUCO wallet username to send coins to.  

Settings like the COM port on which the GD32 device is available will be auto-deteced at the first start and written into the `Duino-Coin GD32 Miner 2.75/Settings.cfg` file.

## Notes

It is normal to get the first few shares REJECTED as they're on a too low difficulty. The Kolka balancing will kick in shortly.
